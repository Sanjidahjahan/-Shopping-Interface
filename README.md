# -Shopping-Interface
This project is a fully coded e-commerce interface built in React, developed from a static HTML/CSS design system. The goal was to transform flat mockups into a modular, functional, and responsive shopping experience where users can browse products, view details, add items to their cart, and navigate seamlessly.
